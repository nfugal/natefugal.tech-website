## Who is Nate Fugal?

_Diving head-first into tech stuff since 1993_ (ask me about my first computer upgrade sometime) [I was born in the 80's but didn't start my tech adventures until '93 or so].

I consider myself a breadth-geekâ€”lots of interests, none particularly deep.

My current main gig is tech support for enterprise level data storage.

I live in the good ol' U.S. of A. where I was born and raised.

Some bits from my personal credo that I deem pertinent:

  + **I believe in being kind.**
  + **I believe in thoughtful design.**
  + **I believe in persevering.**
  + **I believe words are important.**
